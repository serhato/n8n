# WordPress Blog Post Creation
This is a sample to get a quick idea of how blog posts can be automated
## What It Does
1. Collects recipe data via a form (title, description, ingredients, steps, image)
2. Uploads the image to the WordPress media library
3. Formats the ingredients and steps into HTML lists
4. Creates a WordPress post with the formatted content
## What Can Be Improved
- Using the data from a form surely is not a good way to automate posts; it's better to use Sheets, Airtable, databases, etc.
- The WP theme and the templates and theme should be well designed to avoid styling issues.
- The post is not at its best. Using AI for extra content would make sense.
